C/C++ support for Visual Studio Code is provided by a Microsoft C/C++ extension 
to enable cross-platform C and C++ development on Windows, Linux, and macOS. 
The extension is still in preview and our focus is code editing, navigation, 
and debugging support for C and C++ code everywhere that VS Code runs.

Below you can see syntax highlighting, smart suggestions, and IntelliSense for 
C++ source code in VS Code with the C++ extension.

Note: If you just want a lightweight tool to edit your C++ files, Visual Studio 
Code is a great choice. But if you want the best possible experience for editing, 
testing and debugging your existing Visual C++ projects or debugging on Windows, 
we recommend Visual Studio IDE.

Visual Studio Community is a free edition and includes:

support for CMake or any other build system
support for Clang and GCC as well as the Microsoft C++ compiler
support for CTest, Google Test, Boost.Test, and Microsoft Native Test Framework
C++ code analysis tools including C++ Core Guidelines checkers
the state-of-the-art Visual Studio debugger
