As a CEO coach, I’ve heard statements like these many times:

“My VP just isn’t pulling their weight”

“I don’t trust them to do the work properly”

“My team don’t act like owners”

Sound familiar?

When I first started managing people, I wanted to give as clear direction to my team as possible so they could make their own decisions. But with business assumptions changing on a daily basis, I ended up making most of the important decisions myself, or even jumping in and doing work for them.

It put a huge amount of stress on me. Resentment built up and I delegated less and less. With so much on my plate, I was running the risk of burnout, and as my team saw this spiral, they became demotivated and the vicious spiral continued.

How do you learn to trust people and help them step up?

A Simple Definition of Accountability
There is a simple but enlightening definition of what accountability actually is, based on what “accountable” can mean from different perspectives:

To be accountable: to provide an account of what’s happening in a particular area.
To hold accountable: to ask questions about what’s happening in a particular area.
Ultimately, accountability boils down to “What happened?” and “This is what happened.” The expectation is that the person holding someone accountable will ask tough questions and the accountable person is able to answer those tough questions, because they know exactly what’s going on.
